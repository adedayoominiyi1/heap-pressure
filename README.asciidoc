== Heap Pressure Metrics

Exposes two metrics:

* Low pool memory
* GC overhead

Thresholds for these two are described in [TeamCity's Memory Monitor](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/teamcity-memory-monitor.html), and may or may not be good values for other apps.

=== Using

[source,java]
----
JvmHeapPressureMetrics metrics = new JvmHeapPressureMetrics(Duration.ofMinutes(5), Duration.ofMinutes(1));
...
// periodically ship the following values
metrics.oldGenPoolUsedAfterGc() <1>
metrics.gcOverhead()
----
<1> Both are expressed as a percentage in the range [0..1]
